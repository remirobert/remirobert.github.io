This is a demo how to make [Almace Scaffolding](http://github.com/sparanoid/almace-scaffolding) work well with [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/).

## Things you should take care of

- You should change your homepage title in [`index.html`](_amsf/_app/index.html)
- Some variables such as `domain`, `url`, `feed`, and `name` in [`_config.yml`](_amsf/_config.yml)
- If you changed `feed` variables in `var.yml`, you should also change permalink structure in [`feed-atom.xml`](_amsf/_app/feed-atom.xml)
