title: React Native first App ☕️
---

<p class="lead">My very first <strong>React Native</strong> application 🖖🏼</p>

I am feeling very motivated to learn this new technology. But first, not worth going too fast. I will begin with a very simple app. Which has been created at least *one billion* times. **A fucking shitty coffee finder app !!!** Awesome, let's do it !! 👉☕️

The project is available, on [😺 GitHub!](https://github.com/remirobert/CoffeeShopFinder).

So first, I will fetch the data on **Foursquare**, because their **API**, is very simple to use, and it's good 👍.
This is currently how I fetch the data from the **Foursquare API**.

More details are coming soon. Can't wait to release this shitty app on the market.
meanwhile you can give me a *star*, and I will give you a *coffee* : ⭐️🤓👉☕️
