title: Safari 6 Gets Faster
category: note
---

<p>Apple’s venerable web browser, Safari, was updated to version 6 shipped with the OS X Mountain Lion. There’re two changes I noticed: One is the blue progress bar, seems that it instantly disappeared after the HTML DOM laoded without images. The other is, scrolling is really smooth even when it is processing new content on a web page.</p>
