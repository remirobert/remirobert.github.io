<p>This time I use Courier New, a typography that not so popular, even not so pretty, but most of devices shipped with it. However this site still works fine only on a Mac. on Windows, Courier News renders in a burnt way. I also try to minimise the CSS usage for a complete theme. Itâ€™s been six years and my site bumped to version 16, hope this time I can use it for long enough.</p>
