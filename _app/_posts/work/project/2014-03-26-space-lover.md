This plugin magically adds an extra space between Chinese characters and English letters / numbers / common punctuation marks. A must-have plugin if you're running a Chinese blog. This plugin also works fine with multisite enabled WordPress (aka. WordPress Mu). If you love this plugin, please consider [buying me a cup of coffee]({{ '/donate/' | prepend: site.base }}).
