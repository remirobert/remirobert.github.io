  <p>The title of this post is a bit strange and does not reflect entirely the content. I was wondering, after some experimentations, if <strong>React native</strong> was <strong>faster</strong> for the development ðŸ¤”. I am currently starting to think so. I will show you, with a very simple app. An App thatâ€™s displaying an animated Image fetched on internet and a simple label. With auto layout of course. ðŸ‘Š</p>

<p>Alright, first in iOS, itâ€™s currently not possible to displaying an GIF, with an UIImageView, and Apple doesnâ€™t provide any component. The only solution should be to extract each frames on the GIF to an <strong>UIImage</strong>, and then use the <strong>UIImageView</strong> with the <em>animatedImages</em> property. No way !</p>

<p>A little bit messy, and hard stuff for nothing. So <strong>cocoapods =&gt; FLAnimatedImage</strong>.</p>

<p>Second point, the auto-layout. When you want to use it without StoryBoard, programately, itâ€™s a very big mess, and the API provided by Apple, is not very clear and readable. So one more time : <strong>cocoapods =&gt; SnapKit</strong>.</p>

<p>So, to create something, simple and clear code, we must to use some extra libraries for <strong>iOS</strong> (<em>this is only my point of view</em>).
This is the PodFile:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">use_frameworks!</span>

<span class="n">pod</span> <span class="s1">'SnapKit'</span>
<span class="n">pod</span> <span class="s1">'FLAnimatedImage'</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="react-native">React native</h3>
<p>For <strong>React native</strong>, everything is already provided. For the animated image, the <strong>Image</strong> component, is able, to download an image in async, and display animated Image !! For the auto-layout, we use <strong>flexbox</strong> here. Extremely clear, and easy to understand. Sounds perfect (<em>maybe it isâ€¦</em>).</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>As we see, itâ€™s not a matter of number of lines, but about the complexity. The <strong>iOS</strong> code, at first, could be difficult to understand due first, about the librairies I am using. <em>It looks like we have a very big and heavy stuff here</em>. ðŸ™€</p>

<p>For the <strong>React native</strong>, it looks very very easy to read. And also because the style is split to the implementation. It lightens the code.
Thatâ€™s the power of <strong>React native</strong>.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s all for my comparaison ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¤“.</p>
