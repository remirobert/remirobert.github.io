This is an example how to change your page color scheme for specific posts. You can simply add the folloing variables to your post [front-matter field](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/):

```
scheme-text: "#0029ff"
scheme-link: "#ff00b4"
scheme-hover: "#ff00b4"
scheme-code: "#ad00ff"
scheme-bg: "#00ebff"
```

You can also ignore other variables if you only wanto change the background:

```
scheme-bg: "#00ebff"
```
